Using an HTML validation website, I was able to test the index.html file. 
The results of this showed errors on SQL parts and other things that were a part of the template code. 
Besides that, the part that I coded into the HTML file, which was the css class for opacity, came out with no errors.

I fixed the 7th error from the validation by adding a closing tag for the div element on line 11 of index.html.

My thoughts on groups testing:

Blaise wrote a test to make sure the login feature on the webpage worked, and the test was good.
Srey, Mercere, and Akan had the same issues with declerations, but within the scope of the validation test we cannot really resolve that because 
it is a part of the code base we were using.
