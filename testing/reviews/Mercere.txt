I checked and validated "home.html," which had a few warnings and errors from W3 Schools (validator.w3.org). Refer to "homeValidation.png" in this same folder.
Basically, the validator wanted us to add the language (<html lang="en">), recommended using our own character encoding, and saw that we used an unnecessary type attribute.
With the language attribute and character encoding, these are not within the scope of the home file.
For the unnecessary type attribute, I deleted it in the home file.
Other than these, the rest of the errors involved functional SQL that didn't needed to be changed.
